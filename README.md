### Running the app

Pretty straight forward,

- Run `yarn` to install all dependencies
- Run `yarn dev` to start the server which is accessible at `http://localhost:3000`

&nbsp;

### Pushing to Production

To push to main,

- Push your branch online and make a PR to the `main` branch.
- Once the PR has been approved, you can merge to main and the website will be deployed

&nbsp;

### NOTE!!!

- Run `yarn build` locally before pushing any change in any branch, to make sure the code builds successfully locally. If it dosen't build locally, it won't build when pushed online either.
